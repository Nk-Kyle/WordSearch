## General Information
- Word Search Program with Brute Force Algorithm made using C language.
- Implementation including: linkedlist of node <string, int> and char ANSI color print.
- Algorithm implemented in two version : Optimized and unoptimized.


## Technologies Used and Requirements
- GCC compiler (used : version 11.2.0, any version ISO C standard)
- ANSI escape code compatible terminal. i.e. Powershell


## Usage
To run the program: 
- Go to main project folder and run <i><b>run.bat</b></i> file for optimized wordsearch algorithm or <i><b>runbasic.bat</b></i> for unoptimized version of wordsearch algorithm. <br>
- Input file name / source (Test files included in test folder). Example: test/small1.txt
- Resulting searched words and execution data (time elapsed and total comparison) will be shown.
- Resulting binary / Executable file availabe in bin folder: main.exe (optimized version) or mainbasic.exe (unoptimized version)

To add new file:
- Add Matrice of character with N by M dimension, seperated by space for each horizontal adjacent character.
- List of Words seperated with new line between words and a single blank line between list of words and character matrice.
- You may save the file in test folder, or save in other folder and run respective file by relative address from bin folder.


## Setup
You need to have GCC compiler installed in your machine. Run the program on ANSI escape code compatible terminal.


## Project Status
Project is: _completed_
